Hi there!<br/>
It's me, Damiya Gondha (aka damnyeah) — a pre-final year undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. You’ll usually find me buried in my laptop, experimenting with random ideas, or pretending to do some very serious research (spoiler: I do love it).<br/>
I’m part of the software team at AGV (Autonomous Ground Vehicle) and also an executive head at Kharagpur Open Source Society (KOSS), where I get to interact with some of the coolest nerds on campus (yeah, nerds can be cool too).<br/>
Besides tech, I really love music, especially classical music. I like reading novels and playing flute. You know what else do I love? Tech memes haha. I enjoy mentoring and teaching — it’s incredibly rewarding to help others learn and grow. Who knows, maybe one day you’ll find me as a professor at a university, spreading knowledge and chaos in equal measure :)<br/>
I strongly believe that interests may not always imply our expertise in something, rather, it is something which compels us to learn and explore more. And so I keep learning:)<br/><br/>
<i>Why blog site?</i><br/>
I have this strange but beautiful habit of pausing to contemplate life — I feel things deeply, and like to jot them down. And so, here you are, at a space I’ve long dreamed of — my personal blog site!<br/><br/>

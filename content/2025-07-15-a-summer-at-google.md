For the summer of 2025, I did my first-ever internship at Google. Yayy!

I had applied for Google STEP and was thrilled to be selected for the summer internship. I won’t dive into the selection process here, but let’s just say—it still feels surreal.

Day one: I was still soaking in the fact that I got into Google. I explored the office, and it was absolutely mesmerizing! And the food? <i>Chef’s kiss</i>—it was unbelievably delicious! I met my host and co-host, who guided and mentored me throughout the internship.

Over the next few weeks, we discussed about my project. I was given lots of resources to learn from and ramp up. I attended meetings and had some incredibly insightful discussions.

The internship was a rollercoaster—there were nights I spent debugging endlessly and still felt stuck. And then, there were moments when I solved issues in just a few minutes. That contrast taught me a lot.

What I loved most about the experience was the complete ownership I had over my project. I explored different approaches, optimized existing setups, experimented with new technologies, and built features independently. It pushed me to dive deep into the codebase and understand internal Google tools and tech stacks better. In the process, I think I even learned a bit about leadership—lol.

Beyond work, I got the chance to interact with some amazing leaders from Google’s US and Zurich offices. I also took part in fun intern events and made some great memories.  

Interning at Google was truly one of the best learning experiences of my life. I discovered so much about myself and got to work with some of the brightest minds out there.

There’s still so much left to say—but a page is not enough for that, who knows I might cover them in future blogs :)<br/> Until then, bye!<br/>
PS: Attaching some of the pics I took at the Google office :)

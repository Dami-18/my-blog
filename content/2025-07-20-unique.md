Let’s be honest—we’ve all had that moment where we wonder, <i>Why does this work for everyone else but not for me?</i>  

We all have a tendency to compare ourselves with others—and that’s completely normal. But today, I want to remind you of something far more important to focus on.
I’ll keep this brief and get straight to the point: <i>“Everyone walks a different journey, and it’s up to each of us to define our own path.” </i> 

What works for person A might not work for person B, and that is absolutely okay. Maybe we haven't tried something else? Maybe our journey is longer, but who knows we may reach the same destination? Or just, why not try something you are good at? Why try to fit in, when you can redefine your destiny? Answer is, we just don't have enough courage to comprehend ourselves and recognize our own strengths.  

It’s not about giving up when some things don't work—it’s about having the boldness to shift your perspective and explore new directions. To be honest, it's not that hard, if only we had the courage to walk alone, if only we were brave enough to carve our own paths.
